    <summary>What is Inflation rate?</summary> 
    The inflation rate is a measure of the percentage change in the general price level of goods and services in an economy over a certain period, typically a month or a year. It indicates how fast the prices of goods and services are rising over time. <br>
    In short, the inflation rate tells us how much the cost of living is increasing, or in other words, how much purchasing power is being eroded due to rising prices. It's an essential economic indicator that affects consumers, businesses, and policymakers, influencing decisions on spending, investment, and monetary policy.

**What is U.S Treasury Bond?**

U.S. Treasury bonds, often referred to simply as "Treasuries," are debt securities issued by the United States Department of the Treasury to finance government spending and manage the national debt. They are considered one of the safest investments available globally due to the full faith and credit of the U.S. government backing them. Treasury bonds are long-term securities with maturities ranging from 10 to 30 years.

Investors purchase Treasury bonds at auction directly from the government or through the secondary market, where they can buy and sell bonds among themselves. These bonds pay a fixed interest rate, known as the coupon rate, which is paid semi-annually until the bond matures. At maturity, investors receive the full face value of the bond, making them attractive for income-seeking investors and those looking for a safe haven during times of economic uncertainty.

Treasury bonds are widely used by individuals, institutional investors, and foreign governments as a low-risk investment, a hedge against market volatility, and a benchmark for interest rates in financial markets. They play a crucial role in global financial markets, serving as a foundation for various financial products and influencing borrowing costs for governments, corporations, and consumers worldwide.

### 3.1 "Treasury Yield"

(DGS10 - DGS2)

**What is Yield Curve?**

The yield spread, also known as the "yield curve spread" or "treasury yield spread," provides insights into the shape of the yield curve and is often used as an indicator of economic conditions and market expectations. A positive spread indicates that longer-term interest rates are higher than shorter-term rates

**What is Inverse yield curve?**

An "inverted yield curve" occurs when *shorter-term interest rates* are **higher** than *longer-term interest rates*

**What falls under short term interest rates?**

Short-term interest rates refer to the interest rates on financial instruments with relatively short maturities. These rates are determined by central banks and reflect the cost of borrowing money for shorter durations, typically ranging from overnight to a few years. Short-term interest rates play a crucial role in monetary policy and influence various aspects of the economy, including borrowing costs, investment decisions, and consumer spending.

Examples of short-term interest rates include:

1. **Overnight Interest Rates** : These rates apply to very short-term loans that are typically repaid the next business day. The overnight rate is often set by central banks as part of their monetary policy operations to influence liquidity in the banking system. For example, the Federal Reserve's federal funds rate is the interest rate at which depository institutions lend reserve balances to other depository institutions overnight.
2. **Treasury Bill (T-Bill) Rates** : Treasury bills are short-term government securities with maturities ranging from a few days to one year. The interest rate on T-bills reflects the yield investors earn by purchasing these securities. For example, the 3-month Treasury bill rate is a commonly referenced short-term interest rate.
3. **Commercial Paper Rates** : Commercial paper is a type of short-term debt issued by corporations to meet short-term funding needs, such as financing inventory or accounts receivable. The interest rate on commercial paper represents the cost of borrowing for these corporations and is influenced by market conditions and credit risk.
4. **Interbank Lending Rates** : These rates represent the interest rates at which banks lend to each other in the interbank market. Short-term interbank lending rates, such as LIBOR (London Interbank Offered Rate) or EURIBOR (Euro Interbank Offered Rate), are commonly used as benchmarks for various financial products, including loans, mortgages, and derivatives.

Short-term interest rates are essential indicators of the prevailing cost of borrowing and the overall liquidity in financial markets. Changes in short-term interest rates can have significant impacts on economic activity, investment decisions, and financial market dynamics. Central banks often adjust short-term interest rates as part of their monetary policy efforts to achieve specific economic objectives, such as controlling inflation or stimulating economic growth.

**What does Inverted yield curve mean for the market and investors?**

The inverted yield curve is significant for two main reasons:

1. **Historical Indicator of Recession** : Inverted yield curves have historically been a reliable predictor of economic recessions. When short-term interest rates rise above long-term rates, it often signals that investors expect weaker economic growth and lower inflation in the future. This expectation could lead to reduced business investment and consumer spending, eventually leading to a recession.
2. **Impact on Investor Sentiment** : Investors may interpret an inverted yield curve as a signal of economic uncertainty and potential market downturns. As a result, they may adjust their investment strategies, such as shifting investments away from stocks to safer assets like bonds or cash, in anticipation of a market downturn.

A long-term bond is a 10-Year U.S. Treasury bond. In an inverted yield curve situation, the yield on a 10-Year bond might be lower than the yield on a 2-Year bond. This suggests that investors are willing to accept lower returns on longer-term investments, reflecting expectations of slower economic growth or even recession in the future.

However, the yield curve can be distorted due to various factors, and while an inverted yield curve is often a reliable indicator of an impending recession, it may not always be foolproof. Here's why:

* **Central Bank Interventions** : Central banks, such as the Federal Reserve in the United States, can influence short-term interest rates through monetary policy actions, such as interest rate cuts or quantitative easing programs. These interventions can distort the yield curve by artificially suppressing short-term rates.
* **Market Sentiment and Demand** : Market participants' expectations, perceptions of risk, and demand for specific maturities can also distort the yield curve. For example, strong demand for longer-term bonds may drive down their yields, leading to flattening or inversion of the curve.

Therefore, while the inverted yield curve remains a valuable indicator, it should be considered alongside other economic data and factors when assessing the likelihood of a future recession.

**How do you invest in U.S Treasury Bonds?**

Investing in U.S. Treasury bonds is relatively straightforward and can be done through several avenues:

1. **Treasury Direct** : Treasury Direct is a platform provided by the U.S. Department of the Treasury that allows individuals to buy and manage Treasury securities directly from the government. You can open an account on the Treasury Direct website and purchase Treasury bonds, bills, notes, and inflation-protected securities (TIPS) directly from the government.
2. **Brokerage Accounts** : Many brokerage firms offer access to Treasury securities through their platforms. You can open a brokerage account with a firm of your choice and purchase Treasury bonds and other securities through their trading platform. This option may provide more flexibility and additional investment options compared to Treasury Direct.
3. **Mutual Funds and ETFs** : Another way to invest in Treasury bonds is through mutual funds or exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that hold Treasury securities. These funds pool money from multiple investors and invest in a diversified portfolio of Treasury bonds. Investing in mutual funds or ETFs can provide diversification and professional management of your investments.
4. **Bond Funds** : Some mutual funds specialize in investing in bonds, including Treasury bonds. You can invest in these funds to gain exposure to Treasury securities along with other types of bonds. Bond funds may offer varying levels of risk and return depending on their investment objectives and strategies.
5. **Government Securities Money Market Funds** : These funds invest primarily in high-quality, short-term government securities, including Treasury bills. They are designed to provide liquidity and safety while generating a modest level of income. Investing in government securities money market funds can be a conservative option for investors seeking stability and liquidity.

## Data sources for stocks

**What are Earnings?**

"Earnings" in finance refer to a company's profits after taxes and other expenses have been deducted from its revenue. Earnings are a key metric used by investors to assess a company's financial health and performance.


Think of a company like a lemonade stand. When the lemonade stand sells lemonade, they make money from it. But they also have to pay for things like lemons, sugar, cups, and maybe even rent for their spot.

After they've sold all their lemonade and subtracted all the costs, whatever money is left over is their earnings. It's like how much profit they made from selling lemonade.

In the business world, we call this profit "earnings." It's what's left over after a company subtracts all its expenses from the money it made by selling its products or services. So, when people talk about a company's earnings, they're talking about how much profit the company made during a certain period of time, like a month, a quarter, or a year. And investors pay close attention to earnings because they can help them decide if a company is doing well or not. If a company consistently has high earnings, it's often seen as a good sign because it means the company is making money.


**What is EPS?**

EPS stands for Earnings Per Share. It's a financial metric that tells you how much profit a company has made for each outstanding share of its stock.

To calculate EPS, you take the company's net income (which is its total earnings after all expenses and taxes have been subtracted) and divide it by the total number of outstanding shares of its stock.

EPS is important for investors because it gives them an idea of how profitable a company is on a per-share basis. A higher EPS generally indicates that a company is more profitable, while a lower EPS may suggest that a company is less profitable. Investors often use EPS to compare different companies within the same industry or to track a company's performance over time.


**What is range ratio?**

range ratio = (max_price_inarange - min_price_inarange) / max_price_inarange

The range ratio is an important metric for understanding the volatility of a stock's price. A higher range ratio indicates a larger difference between the highest and lowest prices, which can be a sign of higher volatility. This information can be useful for investors when evaluating the risk and potential returns of a stock.

For example, a stock with a high range ratio may be more attractive to investors who are willing to take on higher risk in exchange for the potential for higher returns. Conversely, a stock with a low range ratio may be more appealing to investors who are more risk-averse and prefer more stable returns.

Additionally, the range ratio can be used in conjunction with other technical analysis indicators to identify potential trading opportunities or to assess the overall market conditions. For instance, a stock with a high range ratio may be more susceptible to sudden price swings, which could present opportunities for short-term traders.


**What are dividends?**
