## 2 types of investors

1. Looking at technical indicators - sma10, sma20
2. Look at fundamental indicators

### **Technical Indicators**

Technical indicators focus on the analysis of a security's price and trading history to predict future price movements. They are based on the idea that a security's price reflects all relevant information, and that patterns and trends can be identified to make informed investment decisions.

Examples of technical indicators include:

* Moving Averages (MA)
* Relative Strength Index (RSI)
* Bollinger Bands (BB)
* MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence)
* Chart patterns (e.g. Head and Shoulders, Inverse Head and Shoulders)

### **Fundamental Indicators**

Fundamental indicators, on the other hand, focus on a company's underlying financial health, management team, industry trends, and competitive position to estimate its future performance. They are based on the idea that a security's price does not always reflect its true value, and that a thorough analysis of a company's fundamentals can reveal opportunities for investment.

Examples of fundamental indicators include:

* Earnings Per Share (EPS)
* Price-to-Earnings Ratio (P/E Ratio)
* Return on Equity (ROE)
* Debt-to-Equity Ratio
* Dividend Yield
* Revenue Growth

## **Key differences**

* Time horizon : Technical indicators are generally used for short-term trading decisions, while fundamental indicators are used for long-term investment decisions.
* Data analysis : Technical indicators focus on price and trading data, while fundamental indicators focus on financial statements, management teams, and industry trends.
* Investment approach : Technical indicators are used for trend following and momentum strategies, while fundamental indicators are used for value investing and growth investing.
